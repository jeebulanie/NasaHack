        A volcanic eruption can pose a serious threat, and surviving such a <br /> situation requires a special approach. Here are some tips:

Follow the warnings:
<br />
<br />
Listen to local news, information from local authorities and weather <br /> services. Official warnings will help you decide whether to evacuate.<br />
Evacuation:
<br />
<br />

If there is a warning about a possible eruption, follow instructions to evacuate. Do not stay in areas where the risk is greatest.
Protect your breathing:

A volcanic eruption can release toxic gases and ash. Have a mask or scarf on hand to protect your respiratory tract.
Run away from lava:

If you are near an eruption or lava, try to get away from it. Lava can be very hot and destructive.
Protect your eyes:

Protect your eyes from ash and small stones by wearing safety glasses.
Avoid rivers and ponds:

An eruption could cause flooding due to melting snow or ice. Avoid rivers and ponds.
Take shelter indoors:

If you cannot evacuate, find shelter indoors. Close doors and windows to prevent ash and gases from entering.
Keep Cool:

Avoid overheating. In areas with high eruption temperatures, cool down as much as possible.
Prepare for possible consequences:

After an eruption, earthquakes, floods and other disasters can occur. Be prepared for such scenarios and know how to act.
Have survival tools:

Your survival backpack should contain the necessary supplies: water, food, first aid kit, light sources, protective masks, as well as important documents.
Be sure to follow the instructions of local authorities and do not risk your life by trying to get close to the volcano. It is important to have an evacuation plan and preparedness for unexpected situations.
